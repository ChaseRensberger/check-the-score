# Check The Score

A simple CLI tool for checking the scores of your favorite sport leagues. Currently only the NFL is supported but I'll be adding more providers in the future. Feel free to contribute!

## Installation

**Homebrew**:

`brew tap ChaseRensberger/tap`

`brew install check-the-score`

## Usage

Once installed, simply run:

`check-the-score {provider_name}`

Example output of `check-the-score nfl`:

## Contributing

This project is very new so if you're interested in adding any other sports/functionality you're more than welcome to but know that the design schemas may change and I haven't commited to anything yet.

## What I am working on

- Adding college football next
- Changing the name to whats-the-score
- Improving the release process
